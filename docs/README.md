# KyotoDevLab

Welcome to **KyotoDevLab** — a small independent Android development studio focused on building mobile tools that help people stay focused, motivated, and productive.

## 🔧 What we do

We specialize in:

- 📱 Android app development (Java, Kotlin)
- 🧠 Productivity and habit-tracking tools
- 🔊 Focus-enhancing soundscapes and UI experiments
- ☁️ Lightweight apps with local-first logic
- 🌐 Privacy-first solutions (no intrusive analytics)

Our goal is to create apps that **actually help**, not distract.
